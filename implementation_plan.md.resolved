# Social Media Content Planner

This implementation plan outlines a step-by-step, verifiable process for building our SaaS content planner. We are prioritizing a highly dynamic, premium user aesthetic with real-time connectivity via Convex.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review this phased approach. As your Lead Engineer and Design Director, I will guide you through executing this plan one step at a time. Once you confirm you are happy with these phases, we will begin **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation**.

> [!TIP]
> From a design standpoint, we will utilize a cohesive, sleek UI. Think deep dark mode with neon accents, frosted glass (glassmorphism) panels for the calendar slots, modern typography (like Inter or Outfit), and fluid Framer-like micro-animations for drag-and-drop actions. 

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
- **Next.js & Tailwind**: Initialize the boilerplate using Next.js App Router and pnpm.
- **Convex Boilerplate**: Set up the initial `convex` folder and install necessary packages.
- **Design System setup**: Modify `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` to include our custom color palettes, glassmorphism utilities, and animation keyframes.
- **App Shell**: Create the primary layout consisting of a responsive sidebar and a main content area.

### Phase 2: Database Schema & Backend Core
- **Schema Definition**: Create `convex/schema.ts` defining structures for `posts` (state: draft/scheduled/published), `accounts`, and `analytics`.
- **Backend API**: Write Convex functions (queries to fetch posts, mutations to add/edit/reschedule posts). We will test these using Convex's dashboard.

### Phase 3: Interactive Calendar & Drag-and-Drop
- **Calendar UI**: Develop a responsive, custom calendar grid leveraging modern CSS Grid.
- **Drag-and-Drop Integration**: Utilize `@dnd-kit/core` to make posts draggable and calendar days droppable.
- **Real-Time Sync**: Wire the `onDragEnd` event to trigger our Convex mutation, instantly updating the post's scheduled date in the database.

### Phase 4: Post Creation & Preview System
- **Draft Staging**: Implement a UI modal/drawer for creating and editing posts.
- **Platform Previews**: Build visual replica cards that show what the post will look like on target platforms (e.g., a Twitter tweet format, a LinkedIn post format) as the user types.

### Phase 5: Analytics & Multi-Account Support
- **Analytics Mockup**: Create visually striking charts/KPI cards using mock data to represent post performance.
- **Account Switcher**: Integrate an account selection dropdown in the navigation that filters visible posts.
- **Final Polish**: Audit the UI for consistency, add subtle hover states, and ensure mobile responsiveness.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npx tsc` to verify TypeScript integrity as we build.
- Confirm Convex functions compile and deploy successfully.

### Manual Verification
- After each instruction, test the specific feature in the browser (e.g., visually confirm the drag-and-drop works).
- Open the calendar in two side-by-side browser windows to verify Convex's real-time updates when a post is dragged to a new date.
